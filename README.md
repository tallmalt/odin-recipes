# odin-recipes  
  
My first project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/ "The Odin Project")  
A simple website showing what I've learnt so far in the course. It is made up of an index page with links to each recipe.  
Shows use of file structure and the following html elements:
* `<head>`
* `<body>`
* `<h1> <h2>`
* `<p>`
* `<a>`
* `<img>`
* `<ol>`
* `<ul>`
* `<li>`
